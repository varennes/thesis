# Organization

- Introduction
    - **Use the review paper as content for introduction.**
        - Physical limits to cell sensory precision:
            - Single cell and multicellular
            - Concentration and gradient sensing
        - Connection between gradient sensing and chemotaxis.
            - Building off of cell sensory limits, can the physical limits to chemotaxis be studied?
    - **Overview of the thesis content and structure.**
        - Ch. 1: collaborative work on single cell chemotaxis.
            - Should I keep the review of chemotaxis performance metrics?
        - Ch. 2: collective chemotaxis CPM simulation paper.
        - Ch. 3: EC vs. IC collective chemotaxis paper.

Start off with collab paper since it is about single cell chemotaxis. Single cell chemotaxis is the most basic aspect/form of collective cell chemotaxis. From single cell experiments and theory transition to the study of collective cell chemotaxis. There are two projects that relate to collective chemotaxis: CPM simulations, and EC vs. IC theory. The ECvIC is more interesting. The CPM sim. work is less interesting but more directly applicable to the collab project since its version of CPM is a natural externsion of the single cell CPM.

Supplementary information of collab project and ECvIC need to merged into their respective chapters.

Abstract needs to be changed.
