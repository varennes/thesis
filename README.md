# thesis
Julien Varennes' PhD Thesis for Purdue University Department of Physics and Astronomy.

- **TO DO**
    - Introduction (Ch. 1) still needs work.
        - Write review of single cell simulations.
        - Edit / write review of collective simulations.
        - Write some sort of conclusion and transition at the end of the introduction.
    - Ch. 2
        - Edit / write conclusion and transition.
    - Perhaps (?) add a final chapter that is a conclusion for the whole thesis and future directions for the research presented here.

# Organization

- Introduction (Ch. 1)
    - **Use the review paper as content for introduction.**
    - Physical limits to cell sensory precision:
        - Single cell and multicellular
        - Concentration and gradient sensing
    - Connection between gradient sensing and chemotaxis.
        - Building off of cell sensory limits, can the physical limits to chemotaxis be studied?
    - Overview of simulation techniques used to study chemotaxis.
        - Single cell chemotaxis simulations.
        - Collective cell chemotaxis simulations.
- Body (**Overview of the thesis content and structure.**)
    - Ch. 2: collaborative work on single cell chemotaxis.
    - Ch. 3: EC vs. IC collective chemotaxis paper.
        - Transition from single cell study to study of collective chemotaxis.
    - Ch. 4: collective chemotaxis CPM simulation paper.
        - Frame this as an application and extension of the theoretical study conducted in Ch. 3.
